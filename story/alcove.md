In the corner of the study there was a small alcove with a patform, where Clara keeps a notepad for quick jottings. A mirror hangs on the wall within the alcove, along with a single peonie whose long stem extends to the base of a deep and narrow vase.

The edges of the pad are slightly worn, and some faint blotches are scattered on the top-most page-- residues from a few drops of black coffee that permeated through the empty pages below.

While Clara is away for a moment to fetch us some tea, I write a short poem on the page to surprise her later:

```
There once was a cat named Ellie,
Who some people thought was a bit smellie,
Upon meeting new folks she hides and says "Nopes!",
But if you're nice and patient she might let you rub her bellie!
```
